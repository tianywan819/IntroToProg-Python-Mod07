## Introduction
This assignment is to create a simple script to demonstrate how Pickling and Structured error handling work. This simple script creates an interaction for the users to add data and display the data back to the user. 
## Pickling
Pickle function is used to sterilize and de-serialize an object structure in python. This function allows the user to write and save data into the file first and then pickle what is saved on disk.  In order to use the Pickle Function, I need to have the command “import pickle” to import through, shown in Figure 1. Some pre-defined data is also shown under Data Section in the script.
